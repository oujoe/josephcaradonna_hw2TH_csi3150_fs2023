        My name is Joseph Caradonna and I am a student at Oakland University. I
        am studying Information Technology and will be graduating in December
        with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I went to Chippewa
        Valley High School and did my general education credits at Macomb
        Community College. I have spent the last 5 years working for Roosen,
        Varchetti, and Olivier where I have been refining my skills in IT
        Support. My first job was working at Hungry Howies as an
        Insider/Delivery Driver where I learned customer service skills. My
        future plans are to open my own IT support company for clients across
        Michigan. To learn more about my professional experience see my
        <a href="./html/my_resume.html" class="link">resume</a> and to learn more
        about some of my favorite things go to
        <a href="./html/my_fun_facts.html" class="link">fun facts</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work I like to spend my time traveling throughout the United
        States as I love visiting new places and learning about their history. I
        also have a dirt bike that I like to ride on Michigan's vast network of
        trails. This winter I plan on spending a lot of time learning how to
        snowboard and snowmobile. Currently I have been working on a web
        development project for my friend's band,
        <a href="https://moravianband.com/" class="link">Moravian</a>, which has
        reinvigorated my love for web design.
